3. AI-powered dynamic question generation
4. Review and edit responses
5. Comprehensive report generation
6. Success confirmation with action options

### 2. Starmap Management

- AI usage metrics
- Publishing and sharing capabilities
- Clone functionality for creating variations
- Archive and delete with confirmation

### 4. Data Persistence
- All data saved to `starmaps_master` table
- Automatic progress saving
- Resume from any point
- Offline support with sync queue

## How to Use

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Copy contents of starmaps_master_migration.sql to Supabase SQL Editor
# Run the migration
# Verify with: SELECT * FROM starmaps_master LIMIT 1;
```

### 2. Access the New UI
- Navigate to `/discover` to see all starmaps
- Click "Create New Starmap" or go to `/discover/new`
- View individual starmaps at `/discover/starmap/{id}`

### 3. Create a Starmap
1. Click "Create New Starmap" button
2. Follow the wizard through all sections
3. Answer static questions about your organization
4. Review dynamically generated questions
5. Generate and review your strategic report
6. Save, share, or download the results

### 4. Manage Existing Starmaps
- Use filters to find specific starmaps
- Click on any starmap to view details
- Continue incomplete starmaps anytime
- Publish to share with others
- Clone to create variations

## Integration Points

1. **Authentication**: Uses existing `useAuth` context
2. **Storage**: Integrates with `clientStorage` system
3. **Routing**: Added to `OptimizedAppRouter`
4. **Supabase**: Uses existing `getSupabase` client
5. **Remote Sync**: Leverages `remoteSync` service

## Design Principles

1. **User-Centric**: Clear CTAs and helpful guidance
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements stand out
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Reusable components and styles
5. **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimistic updates
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels

## Next Steps

1. **AI Integration**: Connect to actual AI service for dynamic questions
2. **PDF Export**: Add report download functionality
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple users on same starmap
4. **Templates**: Pre-built question sets
5. **Analytics**: Dashboard for aggregate insights
6. **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience
