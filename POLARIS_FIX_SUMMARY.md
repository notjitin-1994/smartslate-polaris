# Polaris Report Generation - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Changes

I've reviewed your Polaris codebase and implemented comprehensive fixes for the timeout and display issues you were experiencing with preliminary and final report generation. Here's what was addressed:

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Timeout Issues**

#### Problems Found:
- Async job polling could run for 300+ seconds (20 attempts × 15s backoff)
- In-memory job storage loses state on Vercel serverless cold starts
- Sequential API calls not properly coordinated
- Inconsistent timeout values (90s, 115s, 120s)

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Reduced polling timeout** to 60 seconds maximum with less aggressive backoff
- **Added job cleanup** to prevent memory leaks in the in-memory store
- **Improved timeout handling** with proper cancellation and fallback logic
- **Added retry logic** for final report generation with 2 attempts
- **Better Promise management** with proper timeout wrappers

### 2. **Display Issues**

#### Problems Found:
- Preliminary reports missing required markdown sections
- JSON parsing failures causing empty reports
- Incomplete fallback report structures
- Race conditions with research promises

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Created `validateAndFixPreliminaryReport` function** that ensures all required sections exist
- **Enhanced fallback report generation** with actual user data
- **Improved JSON extraction and validation** with better error handling
- **Added comprehensive report structure validation**

### 3. **Architecture Improvements**

#### Problems Found:
- Research promises not properly awaited/managed
- Error types not differentiated (timeout vs API errors)
- Promise.race causing silent failures

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Better Promise coordination** using `withTimeout` wrapper with settled flag
- **Improved error logging** throughout the pipeline
- **Added `reportValidator.ts` utility** for robust report validation

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `/src/pages/PolarisRevamped.tsx`
- Enhanced `withTimeout` function to prevent race conditions
- Improved polling logic with max time limit (60s)
- Added `validateAndFixPreliminaryReport` for structure validation
- Enhanced fallback report with actual user data
- Added retry logic for final report generation
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. `/api/reportJobs.ts`
- Added automatic cleanup of old jobs (5+ minutes)
- Improved error logging
- Reduced server timeout to 60s (from 115s)
- Better job state management

### 3. `/src/utils/reportValidator.ts` (New)
- Report validation utilities
- Structure repair functions
- JSON extraction helpers
- Markdown validation

## How the Fixed Flow Works

### 1. **Research Phase** (Stages 1-3)
- Background research launches with proper timeout handling
- Promises are tracked and awaited with 10-second timeout
- Fallback to empty research if timeout occurs

### 2. **Preliminary Report**
- Job-based generation with 60-second polling limit
- Automatic fallback to direct generation if job fails
- Structure validation ensures all required sections exist
- Missing sections are automatically added

### 3. **Dynamic Questions**
- Generated based on preliminary report and research
- Custom prompts properly validated
- Timeout handling for each stage

### 4. **Final Report**
- Retry logic (2 attempts) with 60-second timeout each
- Comprehensive fallback report if parsing fails
- Structure validation and repair
- Better error messages and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with slow network**: The new timeout handling should gracefully fall back
2. **Test with API failures**: Fallback reports should generate with user data
3. **Test rapid navigation**: Promise cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Monitor logs**: Enhanced logging shows exactly where failures occur

## Additional Improvements Recommended

### 1. **Persist Jobs to Database**
Currently using in-memory storage which loses state on cold starts. Consider:
```typescript
// Store jobs in Supabase
CREATE TABLE report_jobs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  status TEXT,
  percent INTEGER,
  result TEXT,
  error TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. **Use Background Functions**
For long-running operations, consider Vercel Background Functions or Edge Functions:
```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
  maxDuration: 300, // 5 minutes for Edge Functions
}
```

### 3. **Implement Streaming**
For better UX, stream report generation progress:
```typescript
// Use Server-Sent Events or WebSockets
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/report-stream')
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  updateProgress(data.percent)
}
```

### 4. **Cache Research Results**
Store research results in database to avoid repeated API calls:
```typescript
// Cache research for 24 hours
const cached = await getCachedResearch(orgName, requesterEmail)
if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
  return cached.data
}
```

## Configuration Updates Needed

Add these environment variables for better control:

```env
# Timeouts (in milliseconds)
VITE_PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT=45000
VITE_JOB_POLL_TIMEOUT=60000
VITE_REPORT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=2

# Models (ensure consistency)
VITE_PERPLEXITY_PRELIM_MODEL=sonar-reasoning
VITE_PERPLEXITY_FINAL_MODEL=sonar-reasoning

# Server timeouts
PPLX_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
ANTHROPIC_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
```

## Monitoring

To track issues in production, add these metrics:

1. **Report Generation Success Rate**
   - Track successful vs failed generations
   - Monitor timeout vs API errors

2. **Generation Time**
   - P50, P90, P99 latencies
   - Identify bottlenecks

3. **Fallback Usage**
   - How often fallbacks are triggered
   - Which stages fail most

## Summary

The fixes implemented should significantly improve the reliability of your report generation system:

✅ **Timeouts handled gracefully** with fallbacks at every stage
✅ **Report structure validated** and auto-repaired
✅ **Better error handling** with detailed logging
✅ **Improved user experience** with faster timeouts and retries
✅ **Memory leaks prevented** with proper cleanup

The system is now more robust and should handle edge cases better. Monitor the logs to identify any remaining issues and consider the additional improvements for production scalability.
