# Trial Branch Analysis

## Branch Status
- **Current Branch**: trial (HEAD is at origin/trial)
- **Relationship to main**: trial branch is 5 commits ahead of main
- **No merge conflicts**: Current working directory is already on trial branch

## Existing Needs Analysis Code

The repository already contains a needs analysis implementation in `/src/polaris/needs-analysis/` with the following components:

### Existing Files
1. **Types & Schema**
   - `types.ts` - Defines NAField types for dynamic questionnaires
   - `schema.ts` - Schema definitions for needs analysis

2. **UI Components**
   - `RenderField.tsx` - Dynamic field renderer
   - `ReportDisplay.tsx` - Report display component
   - `ReportCardEditor.tsx` - Report editing interface

3. **Business Logic**
   - `prompts.ts` - LLM prompts for report generation
   - `customDynamicPrompts.ts` - Dynamic questionnaire prompts
   - `report.ts` - Report generation logic
   - `parse.ts` - Data parsing utilities
   - `json.ts` - JSON handling
   - `experience.ts` - Experience-related logic
   - `static.ts` - Static content definitions
   - `staticSections.ts` - Static report sections
   - `three-stage-static.ts` - Three-stage process definitions

4. **Export**
   - `exportToWord.ts` - Word document export functionality

### Integration Points
The needs analysis feature is already partially integrated:
- Referenced in multiple pages (PolarisRevampedV3, ReportStarmapPage, etc.)
- Used in Starmap card components
- Integrated with AI report editing features

## Key Differences from Main Branch

### Recent Commits on Trial
1. `de1e065` - "new and latestest" (HEAD)
2. `3238862` - "new update"
3. `d63d434` - "new updates"
4. `70ca6f3` - "new one"
5. `e464b89` - "chore: snapshot for trial branch"

These appear to be iterative updates to the needs analysis feature.

## Implementation Considerations

### What Already Exists
- Data types and schema for needs analysis questionnaires
- Dynamic field rendering system
- Report generation and display
- Word export capability
- Integration with existing Polaris workflow

### What's Missing (Based on Requirements)
1. **Feature Flag System** - No NEEDS_ANALYSIS_ENABLED flag
2. **Database Schema** - No dedicated tables for:
   - Project management
   - Stakeholders
   - Audiences
   - Task items
   - Recommendations
   - Estimates
   - Risks
   - Artifacts
3. **API Routes** - No dedicated `/api/needs/*` endpoints
4. **Approval Workflow** - No approval mechanism
5. **PDF Generation** - Only Word export exists
6. **Estimator Logic** - No coefficient-based estimation
7. **Training vs Non-Training Guardrails**

### Conflicts to Expect
None - we're already on the trial branch and can build upon the existing needs analysis foundation.

## Recommendations

1. **Leverage Existing Code**: Build upon the existing needs analysis types and components rather than creating new ones
2. **Extend Current Schema**: Add new database tables while maintaining compatibility with existing NAField types
3. **Integrate with Current Flow**: The three-stage process can be adapted for our intake → diagnostic → recommendation flow
4. **Reuse Components**: Use existing RenderField component for dynamic forms
