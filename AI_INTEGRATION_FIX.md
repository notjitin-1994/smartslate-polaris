# AI Integration Fix

## Issue
The React application was throwing an error:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/index.ts' does not provide an export named 'llmService'
```

This occurred because the old LLM service was removed during backend cleanup, but components like `SolaraLodestar.tsx` were still trying to import it.

## Solution
Integrated the new AI module with legacy compatibility:

### 1. Added Compatibility Exports
- Updated `/src/services/index.ts` to export the new `aiClient` as `llmService`
- Added `ChatMessage` type export from the AI module

### 2. Enhanced AI Client
- Added `callLLM()` method to `AIClientFacade` for backward compatibility
- Converts legacy message format to new `ChatMessage` format
- Maintains same interface as the old service: `{ content: string }`

### 3. Updated Service Stubs
- Enhanced `PolarisSummary` type with missing fields used by `SolaraLodestar`
- Added `PolarisData` type definition
- Fixed `getSummaryById` to return `{ data, error }` format
- Updated `getPolarisDataFromPage` to return proper type

### 4. Updated LLM Client
- Replaced stub exports with new AI client
- Added direct `callLLM` export for components that import it directly

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/index.ts` - Added AI client exports
- `/src/services/llmClient.ts` - Replaced stubs with AI client
- `/src/services/stubs.ts` - Enhanced types and fixed return formats
- `/src/ai/client.ts` - Added `callLLM` compatibility method

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes the import error immediately
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing components
- ✅ Enables gradual migration to the new AI interface
- ✅ Provides full AI capabilities (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) to legacy components
- ✅ Includes observability, cost tracking, and safety features

## Usage
Components can continue using the old interface:
```typescript
import { llmService } from '@/services'
const { content } = await llmService.callLLM(messages)
```

Or migrate to the new interface:
```typescript
import { aiClient } from '@/ai'
const content = await aiClient.generateText({ prompt, system })
```

The application should now start without errors and the Solara Lodestar chat assistant will work with the new AI backend.
