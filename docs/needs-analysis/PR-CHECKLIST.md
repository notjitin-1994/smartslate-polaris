   - Diagnostic assessment flow
   - AI-powered recommendation generation
   - Dynamic report generation
   - PDF export functionality

2. **Business Logic**
   - Training vs non-training decision algorithm
   - Modality selection matrix
   - Advanced estimation calculations

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for estimation logic
   - API endpoint tests
   - E2E wizard flow tests

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Error boundary implementation
   - Loading states optimization
   - Performance monitoring
   - Analytics integration

## Testing Instructions

### Setup
1. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_NEEDS_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. Run database migration:
   - Copy contents of `src/features/needs-analysis/migrations/001_needs_analysis_init.sql`
   - Execute in Supabase SQL editor

3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Feature Flag**
   - [ ] Verify feature is hidden when flag is false
   - [ ] Verify feature appears when flag is true
   - [ ] Verify always visible in dev mode

2. **Dashboard**
   - [ ] Navigate to portal, see Needs Analysis card
   - [ ] Click card, navigate to dashboard
   - [ ] Create new project button works

3. **Intake Wizard**
   - [ ] Complete all 4 steps
   - [ ] Verify auto-save works
   - [ ] Test validation on required fields
   - [ ] Navigate back and forth between steps

4. **Data Persistence**
   - [ ] Create project and verify in Supabase
   - [ ] Reload page and verify data persists
   - [ ] Edit existing project

## Screenshots
- Portal with Needs Analysis card
- Needs Analysis dashboard
- Intake wizard steps
- Progress indicator

## Migration Notes
- Database migration must be run before deployment
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Feature is disabled by default

## Rollback Plan
1. Set `VITE_NEEDS_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=false`
2. Feature will be completely hidden
3. Database tables can remain (no impact)
4. Or run rollback migration to drop tables

## Code Review Focus Areas
1. **Security**
   - RLS policies implementation
   - API authentication
   - Input validation

2. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading implementation
   - Database query optimization
   - Bundle size impact

3. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Error handling
   - Component reusability

4. **UX/Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Dependencies Added
None - uses existing dependencies

## Breaking Changes
None - feature is behind flag and isolated

## Related Issues/Tickets
- Feature request: Needs Analysis for L&D professionals
- Implements vertical slice as specified

## Reviewers
Please pay special attention to:
1. Database schema design
2. API security implementation
3. UI/UX of wizard flow
4. Feature flag implementation
