# Network Error and Timeout Issues Fix Summary

## Changes Applied to Fix Network Errors and Timeout Issues

### 1. ✅ Job-Based Report Generation (Already Implemented)
The codebase was already using job-based report generation for both preliminary and final reports regardless of environment (development or production). The `/api/reportJobsDb` endpoint is consistently used.

### 2. ✅ Switched to Faster Models (sonar-pro)
Updated all default Perplexity models from `sonar-reasoning` to `sonar-pro` for better performance:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/config/env.ts`: Changed default models for requirement, preliminary, and final reports
- `src/pages/PolarisRevamped.tsx`: Updated hardcoded fallback models
- `api/reportJobs.ts`: Changed default model from 'sonar' to 'sonar-pro'
- `api/perplexity.ts`: Changed default model from 'sonar' to 'sonar-pro'
- `src/services/perplexityService.ts`: Updated default model to 'sonar-pro'

### 3. ✅ Increased Timeouts to 60-75 Seconds
Adjusted timeouts across client and server for reliable operation:

**Server-side Timeouts:**
- `api/perplexity.ts`: Changed from 115s to 75s
- `api/reportJobs.ts`: Changed base timeout from 60s to 75s

**Client-side Timeouts:**
- `src/services/perplexityService.ts`: Changed from 115s to 75s
- `src/pages/PolarisRevamped.tsx`:
  - Research promises: 10s → 15s
  - Preliminary report fallback: 45s → 60s
  - Dynamic stage title: 30s → 45s
  - Dynamic stage questions: 45s → 60s
  - Final report fast model: 30s → 45s
  - Final report simplified: 20s → 30s
  - Final report minimal: 10s → 20s
  - API connectivity test: 5s → 10s
  - Max poll time for non-reasoning models: 45s → 75s

### 4. ✅ Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error categorization and messaging:

**New Error Classes Added (`src/lib/errors.ts`):**
- `TimeoutError`: Specific error for timeout scenarios (504 status)
- `ApiError`: Specific error for API-related failures with status codes

**Enhanced Error Formatting:**
- Added specific messages for different error scenarios:
  - Timeout errors: Clear message about request timing out
  - 401 errors: API authentication failure message
  - 429 errors: Rate limit exceeded message
  - 500+ errors: Server error messages
  - Network errors: Connection-related messages

**Updated BaseApiClient (`src/services/api/baseClient.ts`):**
- Distinguishes between timeout, API errors, and network errors
- Throws appropriate error types based on response status
- Better error details for debugging

### 5. ✅ Updated UI Error Messages
Modified `src/pages/PolarisRevamped.tsx` to use `formatErrorMessage()` consistently:
- API connectivity test now uses formatted error messages
- All error states display user-friendly, specific messages
- Users receive clear feedback about the type of failure

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Faster Response Times**: Using `sonar-pro` instead of `sonar-reasoning` provides faster responses while maintaining quality
2. **Better Reliability**: Optimized timeouts (75s) balance between giving enough time for responses and avoiding excessive waits
3. **Clearer Error Feedback**: Users now see specific error messages instead of generic "NetworkError"
4. **Improved User Experience**: Specific error messages help users understand and resolve issues
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Job-based generation works the same in development and production

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test preliminary report generation with various input sizes
2. Test final report generation with complex requirements
3. Verify error messages appear correctly for:
   - API key issues (401 errors)
   - Rate limiting (429 errors)
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Network connectivity issues
4. Monitor performance with the new `sonar-pro` model
5. Ensure fallback mechanisms work when primary generation fails

## Environment Variables to Configure

For optimal performance, you may want to set these environment variables:

```bash
# Perplexity Model Configuration
VITE_PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar-pro
VITE_PERPLEXITY_GREETING_MODEL=sonar-pro
VITE_PERPLEXITY_ORG_MODEL=sonar-pro
VITE_PERPLEXITY_REQUIREMENT_MODEL=sonar-pro
VITE_PERPLEXITY_PRELIM_MODEL=sonar-pro
VITE_PERPLEXITY_FINAL_MODEL=sonar-pro

# Server Timeout Configuration (in milliseconds)
PPLX_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS=75000
```

## Compilation Status

✅ All changes have been verified to compile successfully with no TypeScript errors or linter warnings.
